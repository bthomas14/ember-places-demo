# Gplaces

A little web app using Ember CLI and the google places library to return a list of place results. I used Bootstrap for some quick styling. Since I'm not using a paid version of the Google Maps API, the results returned are automatically limited to 20.
Instead of adding some pagination, I felt the most useful user experience would be a map that moves down with the user on scroll events.
